## Additional Information
You are not required to add the Bootstrap Framework or Blueimp Bootstrap Gallery to your project to get this Gallery working. I have included the necessary files for it to work within the module itself, therefore, it will work on any project out of the box

I am still fairly new to creating Silverstripe Modules, the frank-mullenger module was used as guidance and this module. I have tested the module and it was working fine, however, if you find any errors or bugs, please let me know.

Good Luck and Enjoy!
