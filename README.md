# Swipestripe Gallery Module

## Description
Add Product Images within Swipestripe

## Author
This module was created by Creative Gorillas (Sajan Sharma). 

###### How is this different to the original [swipestripe-gallery](https://github.com/swipestripe/silverstripe-swipestripe-gallery) by [Frank Mullenger](https://github.com/frankmullenger)?
- This module is 100% free to use. You are not required to purchase any licenses.
- It extends the [Bootstrap Gallery Module](https://github.com/sajansharmanz/silverstripe-bootstrap-module) by [Creative Gorillas (Sajan Sharma)](https://github.com/sajansharmanz)

###### Still To Do
At the moment it uses a [Bootstrap Carousel](http://getbootstrap.com) to display product images on the product page. In the future I am looking to implement either thumbnails or carousel indicators to let the person know there are multiple images that can be viewed rather than having to guess
